# email subscription prompts

Websites that prompt you for your email as soon as you land on their page are annoying.  

Let a person at least look at the page and read a sentence before having a javascript pop up and request a user to subscribe.  

It will more than likely drive more people away from your site that visit.  If your content on your page/site is interesting, it will compel a user to subscribe.  

Let your content work for you and don't over do it with javascript alerts.
