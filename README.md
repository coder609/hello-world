I am new to web development located in the central NJ areaa.  I am currently learning front end development on udemy.com looking to design new prodjects that I may soon showcase in a professional portfolio.  I have learned the basics of html and css from Codecademy and Treehouse and constantly looking to apply what I have learned.  I look forward to making new friends, collaborating and contributing to unique, fun projects where ever possible.
